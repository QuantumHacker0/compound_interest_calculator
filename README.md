# compound_interest_calculator
A simple compound interest calculator

In this calculator, we have several variables that are taken via input.  The description of these variables is as follows:

amount: The final amount calculated by the program

principal: The starting amount 

interestRate: The interest rate that will be applied every year, quarter, or month (as input by the next variable)

inerestCompYearly: The frequency that the interest will be applied.  Follow the below examples for rates for accurate input
  Yearly = 1
  Every 6 months = .5
  Quarterly = .25
  Monthly = .08333

years: The amount of time the principal will be accruing interest.

Using the standard compound interest formula; A=P(1+r/n)^nt, this program will output how much the principle will have grown just off interest in the specified number of years.
